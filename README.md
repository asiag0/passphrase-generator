# passphrase-generator
A simple bash-based passphrase generator with slightly more entropy.

This uses the EFF wordlist to create random-word pass phrases and converts a single character (most of the time) of each word to uppercase, creating slightly more entropy.  It's based on the script created by Arun Isaac that I found at https://systemreboot.net/post/simple-passphrase-generator-in-bash

Sample output: truFfle shakinEss sTrangely bRutishly marsUpial

I may add in random punctuation and numbers in the future for (slightly) more entropy.
